## Hi, I'm Steve *'Zed'* Muir.

I consider myself to be extremely lucky because I have found true love with my wonderful partner, Yasmin.

I enjoy learning to code and hope to transistion to a career in coding of some kind in the near future.  Currently only able to learn coding in any spare time I can find outside of working and spending time with my favourite people.  I originally started learning basic HTML and CSS back in 2010/11 due to a back injury requiring surgery.  I built my dad's website using oldschool methods (HTML table layouts!!) and after a decade-long break, updated it to HTML5 and CSS3.  

I also enjoy watching/learning chess, reading books and watching documentaries.
