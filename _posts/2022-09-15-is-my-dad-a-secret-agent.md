## I'm not sure we’ll ever know…

So, for many years this man has been my role model. He has always worked hard and provided for his family, often at great sacrifice to himself. 

Recently, I have begun to wonder if this man is a secret agent. Often, he moves like a man of mystery and look at him go with weapon in his hand. No matter if he is a **double-oh-something** or not, he will always be a legend to me.

Watch this space for more action shots in the future… maybe.
