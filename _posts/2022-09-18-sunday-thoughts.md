## Here I am...

...lying in bed and yet I have managed to publish this blog and deploy it via Netlify!  I am very happy with it although there is always more to do. 

My next step is to post more random thoughts and to tweak the site until I get the feel and look I am really after.  

Hope you're all well.  For now, that is all.
