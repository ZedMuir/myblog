## Happy Birthday to my good friend Matt...

I know I am guilty of not speaking to my friends often enough, even though I don't have many true friends. This however, is not a piece of text written so that I can profess my excuses to the world.

This is a way to let those who I don't speak to often enough know that I think about you more often that one might think.

More importantly, today is a celebration of an event that happened nigh-on half a century ago! (Don't hate me Matt). A damn good man was born, albeit in the midlands, and the universe was gracious enough to allow our paths to cross.

Matt, you are truly one of the most genuine, loyal, hard-horking, decent people I have ever had the pleasure to meet. I miss you and hope we can catch up properly soon.

Until then, I hope you have a wonderful birthday and a fantastic weekend. You take care.

Peas & Love
