## Merry Christmas to those I hold dear...

I don't have many people that I call friends, but I have always valued quality over quantity. As with anything that is top quality, you can leave it alone for weeks, months, or even years, and yet when you bring it out again, it is as though it has been just minutes since the last interaction.

A true decent friend is no different; when you get back in touch with them, after what has undoubtably been way too long, they are the same quality person as always.

There have been many good quality people who I have been fortunate enough to cross paths with in my life, and had things been different, they too may have been a good friend to have. However, I can only name three that I know I shall always hold dear. These three are not judgemental, they have integrity, they are decent people and I have the utmost respect for them.

Keith has been my friend since I can remember and we have shared so many pivotal moments together. My fondest childhood memories all involve Keith and many more as we ventured into adulthood.

Matt is one of the best people I know and is one of the best outcomes of me joining the Army. So many crazy moments during my wilder days he could have disowned me, yet like Keith, he stayed true and remained a great friend.

The most recent addition to my very short list is Richie. Although our history is limited when compared to that I have with Keith and Matt, we have had many great times and may they continue well in to the future.

I thank you three for being you, for continually reminding me what a true friend is and for taking time to catch up when our hectic lives allow. I do wish that could be more often and I am certain that it will be so in the near future.

I wish you the most wonderful Christmas and all the best for the New Year. Respect and love to you all.

Peas & Love
