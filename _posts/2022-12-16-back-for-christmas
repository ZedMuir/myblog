##Back to Family for Christmas...

Once again I'm on the **airbridge** heading back to the UK after what felt like a long period in the Falkland Isalands. Always feels longer when you're away from your loved ones. Been ages since adding anything on here either; that's mostly been because I've not really been in the mood for it. 

Focused my time alone instead on getting as much work completed as possible so that when I finally get to live on the FIs with my family, I'll be able to focus on quality time with them and fingering penguins! Seriously, don't ever finger a penguin as you'll end up locked up in the Stanley prison. 

Most importantly for me this visit is that I have made some serious porgress with both work and with getting Yassi and Fred to the islands. It started when I had a bit of a mental wobble. I broke them rules they have (4 can rule) and got a wee bit drunk. The next day I spent alone and contemplated what decisions I need to make to be happy and what exactly makes me happy. Well, that's easy; I want to be with Yasmin and I want Yasmin and Fred to come to the Falklands. With that clear in my head, the only choice I had was to let them in charge know. 

That worked, sort of. Finally we have been authorised to move to BFSAI and have a house even though we are not yet married. BFSAI are finally pushing everything they have to get me there with my family. If everything goes according to plan, come mid-Feb, we'll be a happy little family unit living 8000 miles south next door to Antartica. Cool (literally). 

I'm hopeful again, I'm driven again, and I'm excited for the future again. Follow your heart and good things will happen. 

Peas & Love
