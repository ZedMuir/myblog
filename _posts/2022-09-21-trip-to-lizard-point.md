## Visit to Lizard point...

Can't believe that almost 6 months have passed since the family (including the old'uns!) took a drive to the **Lizard Point** in Cornwall. Lizard Point is mainland Britain's most southerly point, infamous as a site of shipwrecks in the past and overlooking what is still one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world. For more info you can visit the National Trust website [^1].

It was quite a moody beginning to the day but did brighten up later. We headed down to the area that has the Wildlife Watchpoint and cafe to get a closer look at what this wonderful area has to show us.

We started off with a much needed coffee at the little cafe and we were treated to little birds coming to say hello.  An example of such a sweet little visitor can be seen in the video below with an example of sweet love birds in the photo beneath the video:

The views out to sea are stunning; the coastline can look calm and tranquil, or when the weather changes, can look intimidating and ruthless.

When the wind picks up, the waters can change very quickly. In the video below the waves can be seen striking those rocks that likely caused many a ship wreck in the past.

After the coffee we were blessed with the slow appearance of the sun.  It required some encouragement to break through the clouds but it made it. As Yasmin and I were perusing in the little art shop, Fred and the folks decided to chill on the bench *(no space for Dad on the bench; hopefully he didn't catch any crabs sat there!!)* and bask in the little warmth that the sun bestowed upon them.

Just around the time that photo was taken, we realised that we were amusing to one member of the local wildlife; a rather proud gull was watching us for a while and even let me get close to take the video below.

Once the sun shines upon the landscape, the whole area is transformed from a cold, unwelcoming grey to a warming palette of stunning colour. You would be forgiven if you thought that following two photos were a different place, however, the only difference is an hour in time.

There is not enough space for me to share the many many photos and videos of the amazing views but here are a couple more for good measure before I sign off.

*There are rumours of a mysterious healing hand; when one sits on a cliff at Lizard Point and meditates, the hand hovers over you and cleanses your soul.* But that could be a load of bollocks.

Final photo of the post, as will often be, is of the lovers *extraordinaire*.

Goodbye for now. Peas and love. Xxx
