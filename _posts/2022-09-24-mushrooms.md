## This is Fun guys...

Hope you like the pun there. Well, anyway, I have never been much of a mushroom *lover* per say but since mum is such a fan, I found myself taking loads of photos of various mushrooms whilst on my travels. 

The following photos are a selection of those I've seen and are annotated with their location. The first couple are from Bardufoss in Norway:

Coming back to the local area, these large fungi/mushrooms were seen on HMS Raleigh, Torpoint in Cornwall. It looks like they the type to explode and spread their dust like spores in the same way a volcano spreads the ash of the earths core.

Some interesting varients were spotted on my travels around Salisbury Plain, both in the public countryside and on the restricted training area known as SPTA (Salisbury Plain Training Area).

Last couple for this post are both from Romania which I saw during a race. I say race, but I was never one to compete in these ultra-marathons. To me it was important to take in the scenery the race routes had to offer, including stopping to take some photos of mushrooms (*or fungi, I really have no idea so please don't lecture me on the differences!*).

So, that is it for today as I am sweating a ton writing this (using **VIM** in the terminal!) in Cape Verde. Killed 40 minutes and hopefully entertained those of you unfortunate enough to have read it. 

Peas and love, and of course, *shrooms*
