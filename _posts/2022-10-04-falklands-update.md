## Hello from the Falkland Islands

Well, I finally made it here after a long and stressful wait. Still not ideal as my Yassi and Fred are back home in the UK keeping Coco company. Missing them like crazy but I know everything will be worth it once I manage to get them out here with me soon. 

I have been speaking with some key personnel, the movers and shakers, so to speak. My gut instinct right now is giving me positive feedback and I know that the fight is going in my favour, albeit it's been a fight since Nov 21!!! I almost can't believe that we've been fighting this situation for nearly a year now. 

It does indeed appear that I was right all along; I am entitled to a house and there is no issue with getting Yassi out here regarding MED cover.  All the bogus arguments that went before were made by the os-called professionals of the Armed Services, the Officers.  I will always try to keep the language on here clean and family friendly, but when it comes to dealing with problem solving, Officers are ~~fucking~~ useless! Dealing with a few soldiers over several days managed to achieve more than dealing with more than 10 - 20 Officers in almost a year. It shouldn't surprise me anymore having experienced this for over 20 years now, but somehow, it still does. 

Anyway, things are looking up even though as of yet I have not had anything official in writing to say I can bring my two favourite people over here. I know it will happen though, I just now. It turns out, that in the role of Training Safety Officer, I am actually a pretty big deal out here. The main man out here, the Commander of all British Forces on the Falkland Islands (CBF), relys heavily on me to manage risk to life and yet enable as much realistic, demanding training as possible.  I bet he doesn;t know that his Officers have royally screwed up our transistion to getting out here. Maybe one day soon I'll let him know. 

In the few days I've been here I have noticed that many (most) people are rather shocked when I tell them that we will be here for two years. It seems that the vast majority of people are here for only 4 - 6 months, with a few staying for a year. It is really apparent that most people just pay a quick visit here by the quality of the paperwork on the system. It is obvious that too few are here long enough to properly get in to the job and make sure that everything is 'ship-shape'. From my experience, it has at times taken me close to 6 months to get to grips with the complexities of the job and be completely happy with the role. Each job is different but that is a rough rule of thumb. Then it's a year of beasting the job and living the dream, followed by 6 months preparing to hand the job on to the next guy. 

Well, that has not happened out here for many years and I reckon it'll take a good 8 months to truly get to grips with the role and put right all the wrongs of the previous years. I'm not suggesting for one minute that my predecessors were not up to standard or did not do the work they should have; I'm suggesting that their task was impossible given they were here for a maximum of 12 months. This is now my ***Mission Impossible*** and I do choose to accept it. I will Tom Cruise the ass off this job! ðŸ¤£

In an upcoming post at some point soon, I shall go over some topics such as the wildlife, remoteness, challenges and weather of the Falklands Islands. For now, I shall sign off and wish you all well. 

Peas and love, and penguin poo
