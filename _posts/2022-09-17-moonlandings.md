## Did they really happen?...

I've never been one of those to give these 'conspiracy theories' much thought but with so many recent events compromising my 'freedoms' and changing my perspective on the world, I have started looking a bit deeper. 

I stumbled across a great website called **The Centre for an Informed America**[^1] and they have a feature article titled **"Wagging the Moondoggie"**[^2].  This article is a brilliant read written by Dave McGowan[^3] (RIP) and is well worth your time.  It is full of humour and many intersting facts about the history of the race to the moon and the Apollo project.  No matter what you may believe, it is a very thought provoking and intersting piece that will surely make you laugh. 

After reading this work, and doing some research afterwards, I now have my doubts about the moonlandings.  I'm not here to say we didn't or we did, but there are some burning questions that should be answered with transparency: 

  - Why has ***ALL*** original footage been 'lost'/destroyed by NASA?
  - Why have all documents relating to Apollo[^4] been 'lost'/destroyed?
  - How is it the technology in 60s/70s can do it but not todays technology?
  - How did they get there, spend time on the moon, then get back in just a week? Today's estimates are longer than 2 weeks!

There are many more but I'm not here to list them all; I just hope that I have raised your interest to have a read of the feature by Dave as he puts it better than I ever could. 

Enjoy and take care.
