## First 3 Weeks Done...

So, now heading back on the **'Airbridge'** after just over 3 weeks on the Island. Can't wait to see Yassi and Fred although the military are doing their best to make me wait; I have to *'rest'* for 11 hours after landing before they will let me drive the hire car home. That means after landing, I will be home approx. 15 hours later and will have to drive at night! Oh well, at least I'm getting home. Also had a great start to the day with the sun god(s) treating me to this view on the way to the air terminal:

Been a very busy visit mostly focused on getting to terms with the job and the very nuanced approach required with training so far from home. Policy documents are my only friends now!! Although I spent all of the weekends here in the office playing catch-up, I still managed to spot a few things whilst here. 

On the first or maybe second day, I saw the Caracara. The tinter-web suggests it is **rare** but I saw it several times. Beautiful bird that the locals call the **Jonnyrook** (may be spelt slightly different) for reasons that I do not know.

Something that really surprised me is that it does not rain that much down here. The wind is on maximum blast 25 hours a day, but the rain doesn't visit too often. Even more surprising when you see some of the epic doom clouds that pass over such as the one pictured below:

It is actually so lacking in the wet gift from the gods that during the *summer months*, to even burn some grass in your garden for example, you require a permit from the Falkland Islands Government (FIG). The risk of fire out here is quite high and the peatlands are extremely hard to control if they burn. A really good example picture is below which shows what appears to be wet moorland looking landscape; the ground is mostly peat and is almost tinder dry beneath the surface.

Those moody clouds do allow for some stunning views, like when the sun god thrusts it's photons through and allows us mortals to see the light in the form of rays...

Another bird that got pretty close and said hello was the Turkey Vulture. Was walking back inside the building that houses the shoebox they call a room, when 3 of these 'orrible looking beasts scared the shit out of me!! Startled is much more accurate as there was no need to change any underwear, but still, it was a close call. When I was only a metre or so away, I must of startled them so they went one better and made me jump. 

I don't really think they're horrible or ugly, but they are certainly not as charismatic or hansome compared to that glorious looking Caracara. Just saying, if I had to choose a bird for life, the Turkey Vulture is not likely to make the short-list. Couple of pics below of the tricky trio who almost caused an evacuation of the unwanted kind:

The 3 weeks weren't all work though; I managed to get around the *city* of Stanley for a couple of hours when Van had to take his car in for a service. Very small, very cute. Not Van or his car but Stanley. Looking forward to getting there again in the future and having a good walkabout with my Yassi and Fred. I didn't get any photos of the city but did get to see Yorke Bay and Gypsy Cove. This is where I was given a real treat and saw my first real-life wild penguin. So cool, made me giggle like a child and it felt good. Couldn't believe how gorgeous they are and how close us humans get. Only seen one type so far and that is the sweet little Megallanic penguin as seen below:

These gorgeous little schnukums were chilling out on the grassy hills just above the beach at Gypsy Cove. The pics below give a decent view of the cove.

After seeing those liitle beauties, the path heads towards a rather large gun that is a remnant from the war of '82 (I believe, please no quoting me on any of the stuff I write on here).

Saw a nice little *moss* ball thing as well, although it was as tough as nails; the world's hardest moss I reckon. If there was a Royal Rumble fighting event hosted in the plant kingdom for mosses, this tough little bastard would kick ass and take the crown for sure. Nice looking too. Mosst likely works out on mossle beach!!!

Something I love is the *360 degrees of sky*; although there are hills, it's mostly rather flat and no matter where you look, you see the sky. It's awesome. No high-rise flats, no skyscrapers, no tall trees (will come back to that!). It should be obvious that one has to be outside, it's not quite the same when indoors! Couple of example pics of the glorious blue skies that can be witnessed here:

![deep blue sky above a green green field](images/falklands-first-visit/sunny-deep-blue.jpeg)
<figcaption>Such a deep blue it was and no trails anywhere</figcaption>

![full moon in a clear blue sky](images/falklands-first-visit/clear-moon.jpeg)
<figcaption>Full (or ish) moon in the clear blue skies of Mount Pleasant</figcaption>

When the winds come down from the North or North-West they roll over the hills, particularly Mount Pleasant, and cause a type of air turbulance known as **ROTORS**. It is these rotors that can cause some serious delays to fixed wing aircraft as they can literally cause an aeroplane to instantly drop out of the sky due to a complete loss of lift under the wings. Luckily, Mount Pleasant Complex is also home to a dedicated team from the MET Office who update 24/7 on the rotors situation with pretty awesome accuracy (which is nice!!). I visited the department as part of my job is dependant on these reports; the kit and radars etc they have is pretty epic and the visit was a good geek-out. These rotors may well be the silent stealth killers for those aircraft of the fixed wing variety (rotors obviously love helicopters and leave them alone beecause they also have rotors!), but they can cause a very beautiful sight by rolling those clouds over the hills. The pictures below sadly cannot show the rolling nature of the clouds so you mosst close your eyes now and use your imagination.

So, that was this visit in a nutshell and I appreciate that this has mosst likely been a long winded journey for you poor souls reading this; *however*, whenever you feel down, whenever you feel beat up, whenever you feel like life just can't get any tougher, please please please just be thankful that you are not a tree trying to survive on the Falkland Islands!!

<figcaption>They tried at the start but it was all too much!!</figcaption>

Must be one of the saddest things I have ever seen. When have you ever heard anyone ever say "When I grow across, I want to be a ...."? Poor thing never had a chance to grow up. 

Well, that is it for this entry. From up on high, a quick goobye to the Falklands Islands. Until next time.
