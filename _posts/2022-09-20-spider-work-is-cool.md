## Check out this gorgeous little beast..

Over the last week there seems to be more spider activity near our kitchen door but one crazy work-horse stands out.  In the clip below this little critter is busy renewing its web and I could watch it for hours.  The web is most impressive as most are, but the anchor points on this one must be 2m, **possibly close to 3m**, apart!!!

Another lovely visitor we had in the *wild garden* of ours was the beautiful caterpillar shown below.  Big hairy beast that came to say hello to Yassi.  The lucky little thing was blessed with a kiss.  Xxx
